# Bandit Vexcode
This code is meant for the VEX Over Under Competition.

It is designed to run on a specific VEX robot, and should not be used in most vex robots.

This repo is only public for the purposes of documentation. It is unlikely that it will function properly on other robots.

## Functions
This code supports basic driving including strafing. It also supports control over the arm and net. This allows the robot to grab and release triballs, as well as launch them. There are integrated programs that perform these actions automatically.

## Autonomous Mode
The autonomous mode in this robot is vastly lacking, since this robot wasn't able to be tested with a VEX playfield.
